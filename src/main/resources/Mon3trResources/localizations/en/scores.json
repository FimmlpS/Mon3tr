      "Defeat \"Emperor's Blade\", Pursuer. NL He once ravaged the demons of the Northern Tundra, segregating the outsiders beyond the reach of civilization; His blade shies not from royals nor nobles, safeguarding glory from the dusts of rebellion. Every Royal Guard is as a dominion; the land beneath their feet is all the territory of Ursus."

      "Defeat Mártus, \"Seaborn\". NL Sage, traitor, hero, villain. The many identities of Mártus are inherently contradictory, but he considers himself only \"Seaborn.\" The ocean belonged to Ægir, until Mártus made it the nutrient for new life, and from its blue depths sprang the children of the sea."
